This is the top-level directory for your project source code

Make sure to add to the .gitignore file in any subdirectory that builds
code entries to ignore executable files and .o (and .a, .so) files
you compile so that you do not include these in your repo.  There is
a default .gitignore file in the directory you can use (edit it to
include your specific binary file names), and aslo copy into any other 
subdirectories in here where you compile code:  `vim .gitignore`
